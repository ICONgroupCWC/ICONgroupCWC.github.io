As the IoT user ecosystem continues to expand, traditional communication protocols grapple with substantial challenges in meeting its burgeoning demands, including energy consumption, scalability, data management, and interference. In response to this, the integration of wireless power transfer and data transmission has emerged as a promising solution. This paper considers an energy harvesting (EH)-oriented data transmission scheme, where a set of users are charged by their own multi-antenna power beacon (PB) and subsequently transmits data to a base station (BS) using an irregular slotted aloha (IRSA) channel access protocol. We propose a closed-form expression to model energy consumption for the present scheme, employing average channel state information (A-CSI) beamforming in the wireless power channel. Subsequently, we employ the reinforcement learning (RL) methodology, wherein every user functions as an agent tasked with the goal of uncovering their most effective strategy for replicating transmissions. This strategy is devised while factoring in their energy constraints and the maximum number of packets they need to transmit. Our results underscore the viability of this solution, particularly when the PB can be strategically positioned to ensure a strong line-of- sight connection with the user, highlighting the potential benefits of optimal deployment."

Goal here is to train classification models to accurately identify the shapes of grid areas within two different square mazes made up with irregular shaped walls. Due to the use of different shapes for the walls, a classification model trained in one maze that captures its structure does not generalize for the other. This issue is resolved by adopting FL framework between the robots that explore only one maze so that the collective knowledge allows them to operate accurately in the unseen maze. This illustrates the effectiveness of FL in real-world applications in terms of enhancing classification accuracy and robustness in maze discovery tasks."

The robot is programmed to follow a predetermined path via a line following module while using a custom object detection model to detect and differentiate obstacles on the road from other objects in the environment. The obstacle detection module based on YOLOv5 architecture can accurately detect obstacles from the surrounding. Upon obstacle detection, the robot initiates an obstacle avoidance maneuver by adjusting its steering based on error measurement, allowing it to navigate around the obstacle smoothly. The proposed design is validated with extensive experimentation, demonstrating its ability to navigate cluttered environments while avoiding obstacles."

    "text": "Abstract\nAchieving control stability is one of the key design challenges of scalable Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCS) under limited communication and computing resources. This paper explores the use of an alternative control concept defined as tail-based control, which extends the classical Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) cost function for multiple dynamic control systems over a shared wireless network. We cast the control of multiple control systems as a network-wide optimization problem and decouple it in terms of sensor scheduling, plant state prediction, and control policies. Toward this, we propose a solution consisting of a scheduling algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization for sensing, a mechanism based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for state prediction and uncertainty estimation, and a control policy based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure tail-based control stability. A set of discrete time-invariant mountain car control systems is used to evaluate the proposed solution and is compared against four variants that use state-of-the-art scheduling, prediction, and control methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method yields 22% reduction in overall cost in terms of communication and control resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art methods."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn this paper, we investigate the problem of robust Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) phase-shifts configuration over heterogeneous communication environments. The problem is formulated as a distributed learning problem over different environments in a Federated Learning (FL) setting. Equivalently, this corresponds to a game played between multiple RISs, as learning agents, in heterogeneous environments. Using Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and its FL equivalent, dubbed FL Games, we solve the RIS configuration problem by learning invariant causal representations across multiple environments and then predicting the phases. The solution corresponds to playing according to Best Response Dynamics (BRD) which yields the Nash Equilibrium of the FL game. The representation learner and the phase predictor are modeled by two neural networks, and their performance is validated via simulations against other benchmarks from the literature. Our results show that causality-based learning yields a predictor that is 15 % more accurate in unseen Out-of-Distribution (OoD) environments."
