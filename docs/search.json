    "text": "The evolving landscape of the Internet of Things (IoT) has given rise to a pressing need for an efficient communication scheme. As the IoT user ecosystem continues to expand, traditional communication protocols grapple with substantial challenges in meeting its burgeoning demands, including energy consumption, scalability, data management, and interference. In response to this, the integration of wireless power transfer and data transmission has emerged as a promising solution. This paper considers an energy harvesting (EH)-oriented data transmission scheme, where a set of users are charged by their own multi-antenna power beacon (PB) and subsequently transmits data to a base station (BS) using an irregular slotted aloha (IRSA) channel access protocol. We propose a closed-form expression to model energy consumption for the present scheme, employing average channel state information (A-CSI) beamforming in the wireless power channel. Subsequently, we employ the reinforcement learning (RL) methodology, wherein every user functions as an agent tasked with the goal of uncovering their most effective strategy for replicating transmissions. This strategy is devised while factoring in their energy constraints and the maximum number of packets they need to transmit. Our results underscore the viability of this solution, particularly when the PB can be strategically positioned to ensure a strong line-of- sight connection with the user, highlighting the potential benefits of optimal deployment."

The AGV has the capability to navigate between a source and destinations and pick/place objects. The human input implicitly provides preferences of the destination and exact drop point, which are derived from an artificial intelligence (AI) module at the network edge and shared with the AGV over a wireless network. The demonstration indicates that the proposed integrated design of hardware, software, and AI design achieve a technology readiness level (TRL) of range 4-5."

    "text": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a demo focusing on developing a robot capable of autonomously bypassing obstacles in cluttered environments using a camera as its sole sensing mechanism. The robot is programmed to follow a predetermined path via a line following module while using a custom object detection model to detect and differentiate obstacles on the road from other objects in the environment. The obstacle detection module based on YOLOv5 architecture can accurately detect obstacles from the surrounding. Upon obstacle detection, the robot initiates an obstacle avoidance maneuver by adjusting its steering based on error measurement, allowing it to navigate around the obstacle smoothly. The proposed design is validated with extensive experimentation, demonstrating its ability to navigate cluttered environments while avoiding obstacles."
